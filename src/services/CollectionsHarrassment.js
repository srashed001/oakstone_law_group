        Everyone has had to deal with debt collectors at some point in their
        life. Unfortunately, not all debt collectors follow the law when it
        comes to collecting payments; some may resort to aggressive collections
        harassment tactics that are illegal under the Fair Debt Collection
        Practices Act (FDCPA).

        Collection harassment refers to any form of contact from a collections
        agent that crosses the line and becomes harassing or threatening in
        nature. This can include excessive phone calls, emails, or other forms
        of communication that are intended to intimidate or embarrass you into
        paying a debt. Common examples of collection harassment include calling
        multiple times per day, using profane language, threatening legal
        action, contacting family members or employers about your debt, or using
        false information to try to collect on a debt.

        The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act is a federal law that was enacted
        in 1977 to protect consumers from abusive debt collection practices. It
        applies to any person or company who regularly collects debts owed to
        others, including collection agencies, lawyers who collect debts on a
        regular basis, and companies that buy delinquent debts and then try to
        collect them. Under the FDCPA, debt collectors are prohibited from using
        abusive or unfair methods when attempting to collect a debt. If a
        collector violates the FDCPA, they may be liable for damages ranging
        from $100-$1,000 for each violation.
